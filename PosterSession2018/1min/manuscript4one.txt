A manuscript for 1 min presentation for the poster session 2018.

(Introducing myself)

They are all so called Feynman diagrams, and we physicists can translate them into integrals.
One can show that they span an abstract vector space, and the numbers of generator is infinite.
However, we can plug in linear relations which come from Integration-By-Parts techniques, and
reduce the number of independent elements finite.

We can still go one more step.
We can classify integrals and the members of a family can be characterized by a single polynomial.
Recently people showed that the dimension of vector space is written in an important topological invariance, Euler characteristics.
