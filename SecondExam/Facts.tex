\begin{document}
For one loop case, in 4 dimension, an arbitrary diagram which has 5 or more denominators can be reduced to diagrams with 4 or less denominators.

Similarly, in the dimensionally regulated space ($4-2\epsilon$), introducing a new variable, any diagram with 6 or more denominators can be reduced to diagrams with 5 or less denominators.
