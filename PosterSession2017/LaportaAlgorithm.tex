\textbf{Laporta algorithm}

IBP identities give us infinite set of linear equations, but the linear space spanned by integrals is finite dimension.
So, by creating new identities of different $n_1, \cdots, n_N$, we can create eventually create enough number of linear equations to solve.
The solution is called the Master Integrals; any integral can be represented as a finite linear combination of MI's.
