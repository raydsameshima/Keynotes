A manuscript for 1 min. presentation for 15th annual city tech poster session.

I'm ray sameshima, 4th year ph.d student of physics.
<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm currently interested in high energy theory, especially 
precise computations of scattering amplitudes.
Scattering amplitudes are given by Feynman integrals.
To reduce theoretical uncertainties, the more integrals are demanded.
The number can combinatorially explode.
One can, however, prove that they can be written as a finite sum of 
Master Integrals.
So far, we know how this reduction works, but we do not understand 
the behind mechanisms.

Within my poster, I briefly explore this reduction algorithm.
