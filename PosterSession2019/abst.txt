2018: Polynomial representations of Integration-By-Parts relations

Scattering amplitude in quantum field theories allow us to compare the phenomenological prediction of theoretical models with the measurement data at collider experiments.
The study of scattering amplitudes, in terms of their symmetries and analytic properties, can provide a framework to develop techniques and efficient algorithms to evaluate cross sections.
To evaluate higher-order amplitudes, a computational technique called Integration-By-Parts Reduction is at present an unavoidable step.
In this process, a large set of linear relations between integrals is generated; by solving them, we can get a set Master integrals, which are necessary ingredients for our calculations.
In our poster, we describe some interesting representations for this formalism and their applications to generate Integration-By-Parts relations.
Within these representations, integrals are fully characterized by a single polynomial, and the Integration-By-Parts relations becomes a polynomial identity.

On Various Parametrizations of Feynman Integrals

Scattering amplitudes in quantum field theories allow us to compare the phenomenological prediction of theoretical models with the measurement data at collider experiments. 
Feynman diagrams and the related Feynman rules allow us to write scattering amplitudes in terms of a class of Integrals over momentum space, known as Feynman Integrals. 

In our poster, we discuss two different parametrizations of Feynman Integrals, namely Lee-Pomeransky and Baikov parametrization. 
By going to different parametrizations, we do not simply choose different variables to represent the same multidimensional integral, the gain is much higher: some properties of Feynman integrals, and more in general, scattering amplitudes, become particularly transparent when we use the appropriate parametrization. 

Indeed, the Lee-Pomeransky parametrizations clarifies some graph-theoretical properties which Feynman graphs intrinsically have, and Baikov parametrization gives us geometrical interpretations of Feynman integrals through Gram-determinants. 
We also show that, in these parametrizations, the famous Cauchy's integral formula can provide a recipe to handle negative exponents in the denominators of Feynman integrals; the price we have to pay for this procedure is simply a dimensional shift.
